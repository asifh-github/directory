1. Where you did the same calculations with NumPy and Pandas, which did you find easier to work with? Which code do you think is easier to read?
=> I find Pandas more convenient and easier to work with than NumPy. In my opinion, code written using Pandas is also easier to read.

2. What were the running times of the two pivot_months_* functions? How can you explain the difference?
=> The run time of code written using Pandas takes 22 ms ± 448 µs per loop. And the run time of code written using generic loop takes 525 ms ± 20.4 ms per loop, which is much longer. This large difference in time is due to Pandas' convinient table-like structures such as dataframe or series which allows easier and faster data mailuputation with respect to rows and columns.
