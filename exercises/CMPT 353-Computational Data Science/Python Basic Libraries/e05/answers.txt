1. By-week T-test (Fix 2: using central limit theorem), because other three tests do not satisfy the assumptions of the T-test, i.e., data is normally distributed and has equal variance.

2. 
Original T-test: There are different number of comments on weekdays vs. on weekends

Transformed data T-test: There are different square-root of number of comments on weekdays vs. weekends

4. On average, weekdays have more comments on reddit /r/canada.
