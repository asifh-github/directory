1. I do not think temperature is a good predictor of the population density. Because logistically most developed countries usually have low population density and low overall climate temperate, and vice-versa.

2. This way might be faster because when the program runs it does not have to process the larger compressed data or have to make sense of the data. In other words, the program can forget about the existance of the large data and can work more efficiently with the data it only cares about.
