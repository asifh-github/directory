1. The distribution of residuals is left-skewed and has the pattern of a normal distribution. Therefore, it can be considered normal enough to look at the OLS p-value, and if the model is significant, we can reasonably conclude that the ratings are increasing since the slope is positive.

2. Yes, looking at the residuals plot and the captured signal, I do think the new "better" prediction, using linear regression, is letting the Kalman filter do a better job of capturing the true signal in the noise.
