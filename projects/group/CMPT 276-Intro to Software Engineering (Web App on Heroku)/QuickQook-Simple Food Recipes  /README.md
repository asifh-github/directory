Project Overview

The Problem
Often people find themselves in a scenario where they are hungry but are unsure about what they can make with just the ingredients available to them at their homes. Suppose you are a university student who has forgotten to buy their groceries because its exam season. Or you are a job holder who returned late, tired, after a long day of work. Or even maybe you have had your dinner already tonight, but because you stayed up for too long, you want a quick snack. Sometimes you just do not have, or want to use, a plethora of ingredients to cook up a restaurant-class meal. In these moments, you want a quick but hearty solution to satisfy your hunger. Our web application intends to solve that exact problem.

Current Solutions
When researched, we found two solutions for this issue that intends to solve it in a way similar to how we intend to. The first one was a web application called “Chickpeas” which also provided recipes that use ingredients inputted by the user. However, the only reference to this application was a link to its website which currently is out of service. Upon further research, we concluded that perhaps this web application was a temporary project which has been shut down after serving its purpose.
The second option is an “Amazon Skill” application that can only be accessed through the Amazon Echo device.  It is a skill that can be installed onto people’s smart home devices from which Amazon’s Alexa can provide recipes that use the ingredients told to it by the user. The very evident problem here is the fact that not everyone owns an Amazon Echo Device.
Another website called “Super Cook” was found that does provided recipes for inputted ingredients. Unfortunately, the functionality of the website stops there and it does not implement any of the other community engaging features that we plan to add to our application.

Quick Qook
Or “QQ” for short, intends to effectively provide recipes to its user which they can make with only the ingredients they want to use. Furthermore, users will also be able to add their own “quick recipes” or “food hacks” to our application which can be accessed by other users. This way, a community is built where users facing the same problem can provide even faster solutions than the traditional recipes to other users. The community is also able to “like” the recipes they enjoyed making and provide us with a crowd-sourced review of them.
Recipes on our website will be pulled using a Food API called “Spoonacular”. Spoonacular has a database of over 5,000 recipes and 2,600 ingredients to use. A separate database will also be maintained which will include recipes added by QQ users.
We believe our application will be the most helpful to university students and job holders who cook for themselves regularly. It can also be beneficial to homemakers looking for a quick fix to feeding their family members.

Features
The first feature of our application is its Home Page, which will house the search bar to input ingredients for recipes. The search bar will also have an option to filter results according to how many extra ingredients the recipe can have outside of the ones provided. This is done so that the users can receive a more diverse search result for their query.
Secondly, The Home Page will also house a section that displays trending or popular recipes. This will be filtered according to the number of likes a certain recipe has received from our other users.
Furthermore, our users will be able to maintain a profile on the site. The “Login” button for it can also be found at the top of the homepage. Their profiles will include information about them such as their name, age, occupation etc. They will be able to see the recipes that they have “liked” and/or added on our website. Indeed, and fourthly, users will be able to add recipes of their own to our application. The occupation attribute will help other users know what the user that has submitted a given recipe does. For example, a student may prefer to make a quick recipe provided by another student.

Requirements
Our web application will implement a Food API called “Spoonacular”. Spoonacular will provide us with an exhaustive list of ingredients and recipes. The recipes added by the users will also be hosted on an online database server. Both of these are going to be used to provide users with a result to their queries. More APIs may also be used to ensure seamless transition between users logging in, maintaining their profiles and logging out of our site. As an API will be used to monitor logged in sessions of our users.
Besides that, all our application requires is coding and the collective effort of our team.  
Group Description

Our group consists of 4 members who are immensely delighted to be a part of this project. We have divided our responsibilities according to our strengths that we are most confident about. Two of us are going to be doing the coding for the project mainly. The other two are also always available for support. The main focus of the other two will be the design aspect of the project and the documentation and research part.
Our group meetings will be held every Tuesday after class. Further meetings will be done virtually via Zoom when necessary. The group members are also regularly in contact with each other through a WhatsApp group chat.
