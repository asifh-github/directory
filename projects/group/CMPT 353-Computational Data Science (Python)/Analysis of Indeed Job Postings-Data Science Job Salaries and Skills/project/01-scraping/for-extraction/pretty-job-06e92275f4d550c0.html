              The Center of Excellence (CoE) in Data Science and Bioinformatics at LabCorp Information Technology department applies various data science disciplines (including artificial intelligence, machine learning, graph databases, statistics, bioinformatics, and natural language processing) to our clinical, operational and financial challenges, and creates opportunities to enhance the value of our offerings to our customers. Additionally, it integrates the data sciences and bioinformatics efforts between the LabCorp diagnostics and drug development units and serves as a collaboration platform to foster teamwork and learning throughout the LabCorp IT organization.
             </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
              The internship program in this CoE provide a unique opportunity for the students to interact with the CoE personnel and get hands-on experience and knowledge of solving real life problems in data sciences and bioinformatics. It also contributes directly to LabCorp research and development efforts to address challenging data science issues and speed up critical production development efforts.
