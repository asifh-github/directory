               About Us:
              </b>
</h3>
<p>
              We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
             </p>
<p>
              We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
             </p>

               About The Role:
              </b>
</h3>
<p>
              Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. The Growth Data Science team aims at accelerating product growth at every step of the user journey to ensure you get the best value out of Notion. As an early member of the growth data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how these teams work together and then doing the hands-on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring where we see the biggest opportunity to improve user experience, what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.
             </p>

               What You'll Achieve:
              </b>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
               You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
              </li>
<li>
               You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
              </li>
<li>
               You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
              </li>
<li>
               You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
              </li>
<li>
               You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
              </li>
<li>
               You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)
              </li>
</ul>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>
               You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product, engineering and ideally with growth teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
              </li>
<li>
               You are comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty
              </li>

              </li>
<li>
               You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
              </li>
<li>
               You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
              </li>
<li>
               You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
              </li>
<li>
               You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.
              </li>
