             Are you an experienced data scientist looking to join an industry-leading team?
            </p>
<p>
             E Source develops groundbreaking data science applications that change the way utilities understand and manage their networks. We tackle challenging projects like forecasting the impact of severe weather on utility networks and optimizing vegetation management strategies. To conduct these projects, we use a combination of machine-learning models, inference-based statistics, and remote-sensing applications. Each project or product is collaboratively developed by an in-house data science team with diverse professional backgrounds and domain expertise. Ultimately, our work helps utilities enhance their electric reliability and prepare to adopt and deploy cutting-edge green-energy technology.
            </p>

             A little about E Source*
             <br/>
             Since 1986, E Source has focused on partnering with utilities to help their customers save electricity. That novel approach defined the art of electric end-use efficiency—better known as energy efficiency. We’ve expanded that concept to include a broader perspective of sustainability for utilities that deliver electricity, natural gas, and water.
            </p>
<p>
             We work to enhance relationships with the people utilities serve, achieve the next generation of savings, and lead the carbon-reduction effort. We help utilities think differently, make data useful, and learn from the best strategies across the industry. Our people, our insights, and our network help our clients and give them the assurance that the programs they implement are the most effective.
