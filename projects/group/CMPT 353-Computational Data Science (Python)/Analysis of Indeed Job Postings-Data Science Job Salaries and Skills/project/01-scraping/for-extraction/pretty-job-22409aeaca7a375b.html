               About PerfectRec
              </b>
</h2>
<p>
              PerfectRec is a machine-learning powered decision engine focused on helping people find good, personalized recommendations without exhaustive research. We are starting with electronics, then other products such as cars and clothing, but ultimately we'll expand into other, more complicated decisions such as where to live or work. (Since you're reading this, our non-ML based recommendation is that you really consider working here.)
              <br/>
<br/>
              We are starting with smartphones, laptops and other consumer electronics since there is an immediate and growing need for reliable recommendations for these products. Spammy search results, fake reviews, and paid affiliate sites make it nearly impossible to get an honest and relevant product recommendation. Finding the right item to meet your unique needs is tricky. And making the wrong choice based on bad information is a frustrating waste of time and money. We hope to attract billions of users, collectively save them billions and billions of hours on their product searches, and provide a similar amount of value by guiding our users to the right products for themselves.
             </p>
<p>
              We're solving the problem by combining actual human subject-area experts with machine learning to help everyone — regardless of their expertise — find their perfect product, quickly. To do that, we guide users through a series of questions about what they're looking for. After each answer, we share updated recommendations and encourage answering more questions to further improve our recommendations. Ultimately, we will get more information about a user's specific needs from a few quick multiple-choice questions than Amazon or Google can deduce from a search query and their past browsing data. This will enable us to make better recommendations tailored to each user's unique needs.

               A Small Team Where You Can Have A Big Impact

              PerfectRec is a small, early-stage startup where you can have a big impact. Our founding team has experience building successful startups and working at big organizations, like Google, Amazon, Twitch and UC Berkeley. We are growing fast, and looking for people who are excited to build a new product where they can have a big impact.

              Our CEO Joe Golden bootstrapped his first startup, Collage.com, to ~$100m in revenue and a successful exit in March 2021. He's using some of the proceeds from that sale to launch PerfectRec and give us a long runway of at least 3 years to build a great team and outstanding decision-engine.
