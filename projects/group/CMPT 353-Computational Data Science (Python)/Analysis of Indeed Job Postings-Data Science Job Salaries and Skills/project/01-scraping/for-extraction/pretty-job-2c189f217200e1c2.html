              Paliwoda Labs is looking for Junior Researchers to join our Data team: Students in Data Science who contribute to the work we do in large-scale data analysis and visualization, while enhancing their own academic skills and competencies within themes that suit their interests; and who may eventually move to technical or co-founder roles within our Ventures portfolio companies — projects they helped to grow.
              <br/>
<br/>
              Junior Researchers are assigned to projects in the Data Lab under the expert direct supervision of researchers already working with founders from the Ventures portfolio. Expect deep involvement in many aspects of each startup you are supporting to better understand business challenges, and to offer applicable technical solutions with a lean mindset that guides them through their growth and development.
