               To solve climate change, wealth inequality, supply chain stability, and national security we must change how our global supply chains work. Altana is a Trusted Commerce Platform built on a shared source of truth for the global supply chain. The purpose of Altana is to enable resilient, sustainable, secure, and inclusive global commerce: Globalization 2.0.

               We have built a layer of shared intelligence across the world's supply chain information: a living map of trillions of dollars of B2B commercial activity, covering 400M companies connected by billions of shipments. This knowledge graph powers Altana's Trusted Commerce Platform - the Altana Atlas - which, after only three years since founding, is already used by many of the world's most important governments, enterprises, and logistics providers.
