              ABOUT THE FLOCK
             </p>
<p>
              The data sciences team is instrumental in developing and executing analyses to drive translational research efforts. We apply cutting-edge analytical methods to solve complex biomedical questions and deliver actionable insights and testable hypotheses. We identify emergent trends from translational analyses of exploratory, clinical, and manufacturing data and visualize and distill data to explain key findings to cross-functional teams and external stakeholders. We collaborate with research scientists to design experiments and characterize novel gene therapies using multi-omics approaches such as RNA-seq. The data science team has the opportunity to impact external publications and contribute to several phases of gene therapy product development, including supporting regulatory BLA filings.
