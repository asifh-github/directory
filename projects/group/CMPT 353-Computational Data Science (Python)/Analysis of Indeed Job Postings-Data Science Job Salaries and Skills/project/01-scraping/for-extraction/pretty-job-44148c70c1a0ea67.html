              Operation HOPE sees social justice through an economic lens. We are dedicated to ﬁnancial dignity and inclusion as we equip adults and young people with the ﬁnancial education, coaching and connections to secure a better future - providing guidance through personal aspirations and life’s challenges - facilitating a journey to ﬁnancial independence.

              Operation HOPE is currently seeking a
              <b>
               DATA SCIENTIST
              </b>
              to analyze and manage data for actionable insights.
              <b>
</b>
              The candidate best suited for this role knows how to extract meaning from and interpret data, which requires both tools and methods from statistics and machine learning, as well as being human. S/he spends a lot of time in the process of collecting, cleaning, and munging data, because data is never clean. This process requires persistence, statistics, and software engineering skills—skills that are also necessary for understanding biases in the data, and for debugging logging output from code.
             </p>
<p>
              Once the data is in shape, a crucial part is exploratory data analysis, which combines visualization and data sense. The preferred candidate can find patterns, build models, and algorithms—some with the intention of understanding usage and others to serve as prototypes that ultimately get baked back into our work. The Data Scientist may design experiments and is a critical part of data-driven decision making. This role will communicate with Teammates, Program Operations staff and Leadership in clear language and with data visualizations so that even if colleagues are not immersed in the data themselves, they will understand the implications.
             </p>
