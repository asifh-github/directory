               </b>
</h3>
<p>
               Nightfall is a cybersecurity startup dedicated to helping organizations secure and manage their sensitive data. As a leading enterprise technology company, our product affects the personal data that people entrust businesses to store &amp; process with care every day. Critical data in modern organizations is often sprayed across a broad set of cloud data silos, and it's a herculean task for security &amp; compliance teams to monitor, manage, and protect this highly sensitive data. Via machine learning, our product makes it easy for organizations to discover, classify, and protect this sensitive data across their cloud footprint - such as their corporate SaaS, data infrastructure, and even their own apps. In doing so, we prevent data leakage, provide unprecedented data visibility &amp; protection across the cloud, and enable compliance. We're a technology startup founded in San Francisco, well-funded by leading institutional investors like Bain and Venrock, and a cadre of security &amp; IT leaders from Okta, Salesforce, Atlassian, Splunk, FireEye, and more.
