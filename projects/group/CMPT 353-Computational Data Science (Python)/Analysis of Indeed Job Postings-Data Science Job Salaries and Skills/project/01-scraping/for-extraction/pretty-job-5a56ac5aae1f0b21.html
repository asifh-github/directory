              The intern will report to Bill Nowlin, and day-to-day guidance will be delegated to either Robert Mostellar or Jeffrey Voien. Both Robert and Jeffrey report to me. Primary responsibility will be to shadow my team as they interact with business leaders to iteratively develop questions those leaders have about their business operations and their data, and develop insights iteratively. We also expect the intern to contribute meaningful analysis to, or solve, a stand-alone problem during his/her time with us.
