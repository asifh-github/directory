               The Tearney Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital is leading the way in transforming the current diagnostic paradigm through the invention and translation of new noninvasive, high-resolution optical imaging modalities that enable disease diagnosis from living patients without excising tissues from the body. Led by Guillermo (Gary) Tearney, MD, PhD, the lab’s 80+ person multidisciplinary team invents, validates and translates novel devices that use light to conduct microscopy in living patients. The goal of the laboratory’s research is to improve understanding and diagnosis of disease by imaging the human body at the highest possible level of detail in vivo.
