<div>
               Data Strategy is a Global team that supports the Equity Research Department and its Analysts by helping to incorporate alternative data into their research reports, combining the fundamental team’s domain expertise and our team’s technical skills to facilitate actionable analyses.

The team’s focus is on thoughtful, defendable, and actionable processing of large datasets to tell a story about real-world behavior and dynamics; statistics, data engineering, and data science are cornerstones of our work, though we seldom delve into ML/AI, and only as a tool in support of our mandate—make our analysts smarter about their coverage.
