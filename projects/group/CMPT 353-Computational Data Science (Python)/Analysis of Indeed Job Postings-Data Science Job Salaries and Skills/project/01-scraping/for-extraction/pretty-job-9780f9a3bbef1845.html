              Research shows that while men apply to jobs when they meet an average of 60% of the criteria, women and other marginalized folks tend to only apply when they check every box. If you think you have what it takes, but dont necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. Wed love to have a chat to see what skills/experience you are able to bring to this team.
