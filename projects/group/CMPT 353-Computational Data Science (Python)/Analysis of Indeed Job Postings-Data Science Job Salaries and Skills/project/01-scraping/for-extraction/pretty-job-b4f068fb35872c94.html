            Job Description
            <br/>
<br/>
            Apply Data Science to create business and social impact by helping patients get on and stay on their medications. According to the Annals of Internal Medicine, improving medication adherence has the potential to save 125,000 lives and $100-$300 billion in health care costs annually. Financial costs are one of the leading reasons patients don't take their medication and we partner with manufacturers to help patients to offset these costs and apply data science to enable these programs to reach more patients and help them get on and stay on therapy.
