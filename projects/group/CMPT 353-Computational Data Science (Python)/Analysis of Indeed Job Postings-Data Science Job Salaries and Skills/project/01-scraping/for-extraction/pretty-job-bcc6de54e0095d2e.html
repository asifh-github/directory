                About Ledger Investing
               </b>
</p>
<p>
               Ledger Investing is a Y Combinator backed insure-tech startup that is transforming the way insurance risks are financed. Today, Ledger is an online marketplace connecting insurance risk to capital, focusing on securitization. Insurance risk originators are able to source capital more efficiently vs. the traditional value-chain. Capital providers gain access to an asset class that is highly diversified vs. most asset classes. Insurance securitization has quickly grown to be a $100 billion market but is limited in scope due to opacity and complexity. Ledger is expanding this market to $1 trillion by building a seamless data pipeline from the policyholder to the capital markets, enabling transparency, and bringing best-in-class analytics and real-time insights to the table. Our recent $75 million Series B round of investment funding has set us up for exponential growth. We are on our way to disrupting the industry by serving as an unparalleled, advantageous marketplace for virtually all types of insurance risks and capital, including traditional reinsurers, institutional investors, and accredited investors.

               About the Position:
              </b>
<br/>
              At Ledger Investing, we are building a market for a new class of financial assets that will have transformative impacts on casualty insurance, reinsurance, and institutional investors alike. These financial assets are fairly complex and involve expertise across multiple domains.
             </p>
<p>
              This posting is for a unique position within the Ledger organization. You will be a member of the Data Science team, as such, you will have regular opportunities to interact with other data scientists and contribute to analytical work at the company. However, the majority of your time will be spent working directly with the company's CEO and Chief Data Scientist on special projects.
             </p>
<p>
              Many of the special projects will focus on demystifying what we do for the sake of both insurers and investors. We are particularly interested in building software tools that help clearly explain the nature of insurance risk, insurance market dynamics, the financial structure of insurance-linked securities, and other such topics. These tools will educate and empower the insurance and investing communities to better understand these novel assets.
