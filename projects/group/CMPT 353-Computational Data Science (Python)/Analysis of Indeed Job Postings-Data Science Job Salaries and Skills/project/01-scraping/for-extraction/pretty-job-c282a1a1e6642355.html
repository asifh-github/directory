               Modern Intelligence is seeking exceptional students, recent graduates, and other early-stage researchers to join the team as an AI Research Scientist Intern, and contribute to Modern’s in-house research program on hierarchical neural networks and their application to computer vision, natural language, optimal dimensional reduction and transferable encodings, and more. This position is full-time, and is open to remote candidates.

               </b>
</div>
<div>
               Modern Intelligence is an Artificial Intelligence product and R&amp;D company. Our products are primarily geared towards the Department of Defense, and tackle some of the hardest and most interesting problems of the decade in machine learning, with a current focus on multi-modal domain awareness and scene understanding. And our research program focuses on foundational improvements to neural networks that aim to close the performance gap between artificial and biological neural networks. Whereas the current trend in machine learning is towards more data, more GPUs, and models with trillions of parameters, the fruit fly brain needs less than 200,000 neurons to achieve vision, target identification, navigation, and obstacle avoidance that is orders of magnitude more robust than any artificial neural network.

               The brittleness and inefficiency of artificial neural networks likely comes from a combination of:
              </div>
<ul>
<li>
                artificial neurons having “less compute”,
               </li>
<li>
                artificial neural architectures produced by NAS and human engineers having suboptimal topologies, and
               </li>
<li>
                SGD and other training processes being highly inefficient, relative to their biological equivalents.
                <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<div>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
               Modern’s research program uses proprietary advances in information theory to train hierarchical neural networks, or HNNs, with modular intermediate levels of structure that address the problem of multi-scale competence. (See a recent interview with Dr. Michael Levin [video][transcript] to learn more about the high-level biological insights that motivate multi-scale competence as a desirable [and possibly necessary] factor for robustness and efficient learning of high-complexity problems.)

               We’re looking for a curious and insightful early-stage researcher who believes that the answer isn’t just more data, and who has a deep appreciation of the benefits of sparsity, hierarchy, efficiency, and taking the right lessons from biology. With your team at Modern, you’ll get hands-on experience with some of the hardest problems in ML from both the product and the research direction. You’ll help build Modern’s research community, and will contribute directly to a research program that creates and trains HNNs in order to address the multi-scale competence problem, work towards natural robustness in neural networks, and create general re-usable neural modules that can be leveraged in future learning. You’ll have as much guidance as you need and as much project ownership as you want, including the opportunity and encouragement to propose, design, and run your own experiments, and to publish the results.
