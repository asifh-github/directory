               PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS A CONTRACT POSITION

<p>
              Balto is a software that coaches sales and customer service agents to improve their phone calls live while they’re on the phone with the customer. Powered by artificial intelligence, Balto listens to both sides of the conversation and visually prompts these agents with the best things to say, live on every call.
             </p>
<p>
              Pretty cool, right? But how does Balto's AI
              <i>
               know
              </i>
              how to help the agents? How can a software program possibly understand every situation discussed across the millions of phone calls where it is used?
             </p>
<p>
              That’s where you come in.
             </p>
<p>
              In order for the AI to be able to make the best predictions and recommendations in the moment, it needs to be trained on accurate, reliable data. Our data labelers play the vital role of listening to call snippets and ensuring that the information on each call is being transcribed correctly.
             </p>
<p>
              Your responsibility and high attention to detail will serve you well as you quickly listen to snippets, check what you are hearing against the generated transcription, and make any necessary changes to ensure the submitted transcription correctly matches what is being said on the call.
             </p>
<p>
              This is a highly independent and flexible role; you are welcome to work whenever and wherever best suits you. The only requirement is that you commit at least 20 hours a week to the role.
             </p>
<p>
              Sounds great, how do I get paid?
             </p>
<p>
<b>
               Labelers are paid 80 cents for each minute of audio they transcribe.
              </b>
              On average, it takes two seconds to label one second of audio, and your speed will only increase with experience. So the faster you can label accurately, the more money you can make. Labelers tend to make $450-$650 per week depending on their speed.
             </p>
<p>
              If you are fluent in English, responsible and detail-oriented, eligible to work in the United States, and interested in getting paid to improve and empower an innovative AI machine, this role might be for you!
