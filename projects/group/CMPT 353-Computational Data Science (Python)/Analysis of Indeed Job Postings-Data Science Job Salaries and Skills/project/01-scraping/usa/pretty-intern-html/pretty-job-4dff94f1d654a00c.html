              Credit Research analysts are responsible for covering companies within specific sectors or industries. In addition to performing company and industry analysis, credit analysts work with internal contacts (trading, sales, investment banking, etc.) and external clients (money managers, pension funds, hedge funds, etc.) on a regular basis in order to better evaluate the credit markets. This is a fast-paced and exciting role requiring a high degree of interaction and partnership with Sales &amp; Trading.
