               About You
              </b>
</p>
<p>
              The Data Scientist and Visualization Developer plays a key role in our ability to understand data and turn it into actionable information. They are at the pivot-point of insight to action, where hypothesis and new outcomes are discovered, tested, communicated, and explained. These discoveries are then translated into human and system behaviors that drive improved results for the organization. This role understands both business and how to apply data analysis techniques. This individual can communicate effectively with both business process owners, data subject matter experts, and technical systems resources. They understand how to elicit needs and display their findings in language that business stakeholders and the team can understand.
