              Internet service providers, meet the Un-carrier. We’re standing up for Consumers &amp; businesses to redefine an industry. Ever feel like high-speed internet in hard-to-reach areas is an impossible ask? We are working to change that by building a network to serve small town and rural areas, that traditional providers have ignored. We’re competing in urban areas because we think you deserve a better choice. Our team builds the enabling technology behind this revolution. We are a fast-moving team of architects and data engineers; that build, run, and operate the back-end data operations to support customer acquisition and analysis. If you enjoy being part of a team who is working on data pipelines, digging into data anomalies, and writing infrastructure as code to deploy changes to the cloud we want to talk to you. We are looking for team members who can critically analyze a problem, collaborate with product management to find a solution, and own the delivery of that solution to the end customer.
