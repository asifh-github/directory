              Welcome to Perennial.
             </h2>
<p>
              Perennial is building the world's leading verification platform for soil-based carbon removal. Our vision is to unlock soil as the world's largest carbon sink. To do that, we are building trusted standards, tools, and technologies to help verify climate-smart agriculture.
             </p>
<p>
              Perennial uses the world's most advanced remote measurement technology for soil carbon sequestration and emissions. We fuse machine learning, ground observations, and satellite data to map soil carbon and land-based GHG emissions at continent-level scales. This technology is powering the future of climate-smart agriculture and helping the food supply chain decarbonize.
             </p>
<p>
              At Perennial, you will work in a mission-driven and collaborative environment alongside a diverse team with backgrounds spanning science, technology, carbon markets, and agriculture.
             </p>
<p>
              Our HQ is located in Boulder, CO USA. We are a fully-flexible company for remote and hybrid work.
             </p>
<p>
              We've raised $25M+ from mission-aligned investors including Temasek, Bloomberg, Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund, SineWave Ventures, Alumni Ventures Group, and Collaborative Fund.
             </p>

              About the Role:
             </h2>
<p>
              As the Head of Data Science, you will lead a team to develop clearly defined models and algorithms that quantify carbon content in farmland from local to continent scales. Output from these algorithms will directly support the issuance of carbon offset credits underpinned by Perennial's award-winning technology. You will play a foundational role in shaping the strategy, architecture, and buildout of Perennial's data-driven quantification methodology. You will manage an excellent team of data scientists and applied scientists to execute Perennial's vision, and will report directly to the CTO. You will work closely with the VP of Engineering and VP or Product, and will be expected to communicate technical data science issues to stakeholders outside the data science and engineering teams. This is a tremendous opportunity to join a productive team at a pivotal time, and to apply your leadership skills to one of the most challenging and important problems in climate tech.
