<p>
<b>
                As a Data Scientist within the Volcano Science Center, Cascade Volcano Observatory, some of your specific duties will include:
               </b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
                Coordinate data management and integration for the Volcano Science Center.
               </li>
<li>
                Document, manage quality, and archive image data or volcano monitoring.
               </li>
<li>
                Represent the Agency, Bureau, and Volcano Science Center as a subject-matter expert in the field of InSAR and satellite remote sensing data.
               </li>
<li>
                Publish research related to remote sensing imagery of volcanic activity in peer-reviewed journals.
               </li>
<li>
                Lead research and development of new computational tools, modeling approaches, and analysis methods for remote sensing data from volcanoes.
               </li>
<li>
                Support Program and Bureau scientists with application of remote sensing data to volcano research and monitoring.
               </li>
</ul>
<b>
               Physical Demands:
              </b>
<br/>
              The work is usually sedentary but may include lifting of light office objects. Occasional travel is required to training, meetings, conferences, or incidental voluntary trips to the field. Incidental and optional field work to assist with ground-based volcano monitoring may occur. This may include occasional vehicle and on-foot travel to field locations and carrying loads of up to 50 lbs in rugged environments subject to extreme weather, volcanic gases, and other hazards common at volcanoes and in remote field locations.
              <br/>
<br/>
<b>
               Work Environment:
              </b>
<br/>
              The work is generally performed in an office environment that is adequately lighted, heated, and ventilated. Travel via airplane will be required to attend space-agency meetings and to confer with scientists at academic conferences. Some of these meetings will occur outside the USA. Some weather and volcano hazards may necessitate wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (clothing, respirators, etc.)
