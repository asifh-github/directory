               The Challenge:
              </b>
</p>
<p>
              Are you excited at the prospect of unlocking the secrets held by a data set? Are you fascinated by the possibilities presented by the IoT, machine learning, and artificial intelligence advances? In an increasingly connected world, massive amounts of structured and unstructured data open up new opportunities. As a data analyst intern, you can turn these complex data sets into useful information to solve global challenges. Across private and public sectors — from fraud detection, to cancer research, to national intelligence — you know the answers are in the data.
             </p>
<p>
              We have an opportunity for you to use your analytical skills to improve our business. You’ll work closely with your customer to understand their questions and needs, and then dig into their data-rich environment to find the pieces of their information puzzle. You’ll apply analytical skills and use the right combination of tools and frameworks to turn that set of disparate data points into objective answers to help clients make informed decisions. You’ll provide your customer with a deep understanding of their data, what it all means, and how they can use it. This position is a hybrid role with a combination of working at a Booz Allen office or client site and working remotely.
             </p>
<p>
              Join us as we use data science for good in consulting.
             </p>
<p>
              Empower change with us.
