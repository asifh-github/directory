               Data Scientist
              </b>
</p>
<p>
              Acrisure Technology Group (ATG) is a fast paced, AI and data science driven team building innovative software to disrupt the $6T+ insurance industry. Our mission is to help the world share its risk more intelligently to power a more vibrant economy. To do this, we are transforming insurance distribution and underwriting into a science.
             </p>
<p>
              At the core of our operating model is our technology: we're building an AI driven digital marketplace for risk and applying it at the center of Acrisure, a privately held company recognized as one of the world's top 10 insurance brokerages and the fastest growing insurance brokerage globally. By leveraging technology to push the boundaries of understanding and transferring risk, we are systematically converting data into predictions, insights, and choices that drive the insurance industry forward.
             </p>
<p>
              We are a growing team of AI Engineers and Data Scientists, teamed up with seasoned industry expertise. We are taking an aggressive approach to leverage AI to disrupt all aspects of the insurance industry for the benefit of our customers and society, but there are many problems left to solve. We have a long term strategy and dedicate time weekly to explore datasets and think about areas for future impact, asking ourselves "what else can we do?"
             </p>
<p>
              As a Data Scientist, you will research, develop, and deploy AI and Data Science solutions to support our mission. You will dive deep into datasets and use your expertise to build models that add value to our business and industry. We believe in starting with the simplest viable solution and iterating as needed, measuring progress and value added along the way. If this sounds like something you'd like to do, come help us to turn our vision into reality!
