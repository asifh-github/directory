              </b>
</p>
<p>
              At Parafin, our mission is to grow small businesses. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, yet banks do not have their back. Parafin is a technology company that builds infrastructure which enables small businesses to get easy access to financial services via platforms they sell on.
             </p>
<p>
              Parafin's first product offers capital-as-a-service for online platforms. Parafin currently powers the capital programs of platforms ranging from Series B to post IPO companies. We are a tight knit team of engineers and designers, coming from organizations such as Robinhood, Affirm, CapitalOne, Uber and CERN, excited both about helping hundreds of thousands of small businesses grow and thrive, and building products that leaders at top companies have started to use every day. We are backed by prominent venture capitalists such as Ribbit Capital, Thrive Capital, Index Ventures, Green Oaks Capital and SV Angel.
