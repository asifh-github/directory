              </b>
</p>
<p>
              Buoy is on a mission to build the most robust destination for managing health needs. By pairing our AI navigation capabilities with an agnostic marketplace of third-party health solutions and care providers, we are matching people with the best care for their unique situation. One of Buoy’s greatest differentiators is leveraging our machine learning algorithms to intake users’ symptoms and provide a potential diagnosis and triage recommendation.
              <br/>
<br/>
              As a Data Scientist at Buoy, your core responsibility is to solve problems intelligently and creatively. You will work with Buoy’s product and medical teams to improve the way users find and engage with care through Buoy. You will apply both classical and modern machine learning techniques. You will formulate hypotheses and design experiments to evaluate them. You will develop, specify, and implement validation methods that scale and ensure that other teams are empowered to do the same. You will communicate insights about user behavior, agent behavior, data quality, and data completeness to different teams across the company. To be successful, you must have a keen interest in data-driven decision making and helping people make better decisions about their health.
