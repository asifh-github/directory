              The Data and Analytics Department for TFS is looking for a
              <b>
               Data Science Apprentice
              </b>
              who wants to begin this continuous journey of development through formal classroom development and hands-on work supporting TFS objectives.
             </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
              Apprentices are hired and paid with the intention of growing both the Apprentice’s practical knowledge of Data Science as well as the theoretical underpinnings of the work. In the first year, a customized training plan will be developed and executed to bolster and expand the Apprentice’s academic and professional experience. This training plan may include formal courses in Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science. The Apprentice will be paired with a mentor Data Scientist to jointly solve real-world modeling projects that support the business. The mentor will help guide the Apprentice in best practices with a heavy focus on modeling fundamentals, modern computing, and delivering value to the business. Success in this role requires tenacious curiosity, a practical mindset, and the courage to iterate through test-and-failure.
             </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
              Progress and ultimate completion of the apprenticeship will be evaluated on the Apprentice’s ability to demonstrate competency in modeling frameworks, understanding of general and specific business principles, progressive coding skills, and ability to collaborate with the team. After reaching this level of competency, the Apprentice will ‘graduate’ to a Data Scientist role that is typically reserved for candidates with a graduate degree in a quantitative discipline. In this way, we view this Apprenticeship as an alternative to a master’s degree in a quantitative field.
