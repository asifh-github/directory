<b>
                   Impact
                  </b>
                  - You’re deeply mission-driven and you think there’s more to life than software that enables puppy ears to be superimposed on photos. Although we concede those are cute.
                 </li>
<li>
<b>
                   Entrepreneurship
                  </b>
                  - You’re a self-starter who loves to own things end-to-end. You don’t ask for permission - you’re too busy making things happen.
                 </li>
<li>
<b>
                   Full stack
                  </b>
                  - You’ve done front-end, back-end, and every kind of end.
                 </li>
<li>
<b>
                   Curiosity
                  </b>
                  - You like to mess around with computer vision, hardware hacking, or bioinformatics in your free time? You made your own smart mirror? Boy have we got some fun things for you…
                 </li>
<li>
<b>
                   Product passion
                  </b>
                  - You care about the bits you ship ending up in users’ hands. You don’t really need a product manager because you’re basically one yourself.
                 </li>
<li>
<b>
                   Building good teams
                  </b>
                  - Not managing them, building them. You know how to make those around you better and feed off their energy. You take care of your teammates.
