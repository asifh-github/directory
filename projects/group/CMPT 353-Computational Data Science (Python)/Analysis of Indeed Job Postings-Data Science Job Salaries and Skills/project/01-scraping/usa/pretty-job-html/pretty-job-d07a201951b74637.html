               The Mission
              </b>
</h2>
<p>
              The electrical grid was built to carry electricity unidirectionally from central fossil fuel plants to end consumers. As we transition to a renewable future built from rooftop solar and community storage, the grid itself needs an overhaul. Span's goal is to reinvent the grid from a clean slate to enable that transition, envisioning a grid made of distributed control systems and software as much as copper wires.
             </p>
<p>
              To accomplish this, we are upgrading the breaker panel — the humble box sitting at the center of every building's electrical wiring — to monitor, control, and make decisions about energy. This converts buildings from passive consumers in a centralized fossil fuel grid to active participants in the emerging distributed energy market.
             </p>
<p>
              SPAN's unique commitment to clean-slate "right architecture" and our zealotry for top-caliber customer experience position us as domain leaders in envisioning the distributed grid and have allowed us to achieve rapid growth and high visibility in the industry in the two years since we launched.
             </p>
<h2 class="jobSectionHeader">
<b>
               The Role
              </b>
</h2>
<p>
              We aim to establish the SPAN panel as the center of home energy and the backbone of the renewable distributed grid. Analytics and ML are essential tools to develop features for the smart, green, energy-efficient home of the future. SPANn's unique ability to monitor and control individual circuits opens up a new avenue for proactive whole-home management and equipment failure detection. As Data Scientist, you will leverage your deep understanding of ML, modeling, and statistics to solve problems including anomaly detection, time series forecasting, and event prediction with the goal to optimally manage whole-home energy consumption, deliver meaningful insights to the customer, and notify them about a potential failure of equipment or hazards in their home. You'll be involved through the entire development process, from the acquisition of all additional third-party data, the initial design to remote monitoring in the field.
