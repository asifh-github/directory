<p>
               Our thirst for technology is a part of everything we do. The Data Center Engineering team takes the physical design of our data centers into the future. Our lab mirrors a research and development department - cutting-edge strategies are born, tested and tested again. Along with a team of great minds, you take on complex topics like how we use power or how to run state-of-the-art, environmentally-friendly facilities. You're a visionary who optimizes for efficiencies and never stops seeking improvements - even small changes that can make a huge impact. You generate ideas, communicate recommendations to senior-level executives and drive implementation alongside facilities technicians.
               <br/>
<br/>
               With your technical expertise, you ensure compliance with codes and standards, develop infrastructure improvements and serve as an expert in your specialty (e.g., cooling, electrical).
              </p>
<p>
               Google is transforming how hyper-scale data centers are planned, designed, and built. As a Data Center Mechanical Design Engineer, you will own and design to the entire product design life cycle - including requirements gathering, concept generation, detailed design with analysis, verification testing, cross-functional reviews, and manufacturing release. You will develop and execute designs for complex systems backed by rigorous engineering analysis.
              </p>
