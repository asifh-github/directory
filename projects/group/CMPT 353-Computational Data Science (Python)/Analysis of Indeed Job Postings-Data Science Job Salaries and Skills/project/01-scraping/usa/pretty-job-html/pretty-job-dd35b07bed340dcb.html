               We’re looking for accomplished researchers who are interested in growing their career in the field of quantitative finance. The type of problems we solve at SIG are often different from the subject of your PhD thesis, but nonetheless, our problems demand the attention of brilliant minds that have an extraordinary attention to detail and a relentless pursuit of understanding.

               The general lifecycle of a quant project begins with an idea:
              </div>
<div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<br/>
                This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
               </li>
<li>
                As a Quantitative Researcher, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
               </li>
<li>
                Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
               </li>
<li>
                You will work side-by-side with technologists in order to backtest your results and put that trading signal into production.
               </li>
<li>
                Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will continue to do research on that strategy in order to optimize its performance.
               </li>
<li>
                As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
               </li>
<li>
                Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.
               </li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>
               What we're looking for
              </b>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>
                PhD or Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
               </li>
<li>
                Exceptional mathematical problem-solving skills
               </li>
<li>
                Solid communication skills, both in the ability to understand others and to make yourself clearly understood
               </li>
<li>
                Strong, practical computing skills; a specific language proficiency is less important than your ability to get computers to accomplish tasks efficiently and reliably
               </li>
<li>
                Experience working on in-depth research projects
               </li>
<li>
                Finance experience is a plus, but not required
               </li>
</ul>
<div>
</div>
<div>
<br/>
               By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Strategist position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.
              </div>

<div>
<br/>
               Visa sponsorship is available for this position.
