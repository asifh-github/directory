                Netflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service with 200+ million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. Netflix is reinventing entertainment from end to end. We are revolutionizing how shows and movies are produced, pushing technological boundaries to efficiently deliver streaming video at massive scale over the internet, and continuously improving and personalizing how content is presented around the globe.

                Throughout our business, Netflix employs a simple but powerful approach to product innovation and decision making: we ask our members, through experiments (online or quasi), which of several possible experiences resonate with them. To support experimentation at scale, we continuously invest in our democratized experimentation platform that supports contributions of metrics and inference methods from users of all backgrounds, and permits experimenters to use these building blocks to develop flexible and powerful workflows. We are always looking to improve our decision making capabilities by exploring, developing, and implementing new approaches to the design and analysis of randomized experiments, and by leveraging approaches from observational causal inference.

                The Summer Internship
               </div>
<div>
                At Netflix, we offer a personalized experience for interns, and our aim is to offer an experience that mimics what it is like to actually work here. We match qualified interns with projects and groups based on interests and skill sets, and fully embed interns within those groups for the summer. Netflix is a unique place to work and we live by our values, so it's worth learning more about our culture.
               </div>

                Internships are paid and are a minimum of 12 weeks, with a choice of a few fixed start dates in May or June to accommodate varying school calendars. Our summer internships in 2023 will be located — depending on the team — either in our Los Gatos, CA, or in our Los Angeles, CA, office.
