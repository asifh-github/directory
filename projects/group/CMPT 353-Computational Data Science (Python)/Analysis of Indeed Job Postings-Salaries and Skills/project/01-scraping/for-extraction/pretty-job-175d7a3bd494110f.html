             </p>
<p>
              Our Summer Internship Opportunity:
             </p>
<p>
              This internship program will provide you with the opportunity to apply the economic concepts you’re learning in the classroom in a professional services setting. It will also help you to improve your research and data analysis skills as well as learn to manage and prioritize tasks. You will work side by side with internationally recognized experts in financial economics, corporate finance, energy, competition, and regulatory economics.
             </p>
<p>
              Typical Assignments Might Include:
             </p>
<ul>
<li>
               Providing in-depth research, summarizing documents, and communicating with project team members at all levels
              </li>
<li>
               Auditing and contributing to the creation of financial, economic, and operational models
              </li>
<li>
               Adapting economic theory to apply to real life questions and problems
              </li>
</ul>
<p>
              You will work in a collaborative and fun atmosphere where dedication to project success and individual career and professional development are emphasized. You will have the opportunity to discover where your strengths and interests lie and how you can best apply your skills. The work environment is casual; the atmosphere is collegial; and there is significant, on-going contact between senior and junior staff. This is a hybrid role with in-office and remote working expectations.
