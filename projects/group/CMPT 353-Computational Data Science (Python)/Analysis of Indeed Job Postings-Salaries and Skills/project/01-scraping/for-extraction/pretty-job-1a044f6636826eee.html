                The Summer Internship
               </div>
<div>
                Our approach to internships is different: like Netflix itself, we offer a personalized experience for interns, and our aim is to offer an experience that mimics what it is like to actually work here. We match qualified interns with projects and groups based on interests and skill sets, and fully embed interns within those groups for the summer. Netflix is a unique place to work and we live by our values, so it's worth learning more about our culture.
               </div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
<br/>
                Internships will be a minimum of 12 weeks, with timing flexible to candidate needs. Conditions permitting, our summer internships in 2022 will be located — depending on the team — either, in our Los Gatos, CA, or in our Los Angeles, CA, office.

<br/>
                Netflix is an equal opportunity employer that celebrates diversity, recognizing that diversity of thought and background builds stronger teams. We approach diversity and inclusion seriously and thoughtfully. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.
