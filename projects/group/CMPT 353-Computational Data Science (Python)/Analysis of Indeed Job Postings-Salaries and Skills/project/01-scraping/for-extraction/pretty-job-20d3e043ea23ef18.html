              Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a substantially under-diagnosed condition that affects 37 million people in the US. Today, clinical and care management teams use our platform to identify the most at risk-individuals and proactively deliver care in advance of adverse events, delivering better clinical outcomes at a lower cost. Our clients are risk-bearing healthcare enterprises: ACOs, kidney clinics and nephrology practices, large health systems, managed care and health insurance companies. Together, we use data science to deliver more human care.
