</div>
<div>
              Data science, data analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are increasingly gaining momentum in NATO touching all military and political domains and functional areas. In response to HQ SACT’s understanding of the disruptive potential of data science and AI, and recognizing the strategic value of data, the Data Science &amp; Artificial Intelligence section, established in 2020 in the Federated Interoperability Branch, is focusing on data science and AI as cross-cutting and enabling capabilities for HQ SACT and the NATO Enterprise. The section provides a broad spectrum from strategy and policy development and support to technical delivery and implementation to HQ SACT and the NATO Enterprise. In addition to serving as the centre of gravity for HQ SACT’s efforts in advancing data centricity and integrating rapidly changing technology related to data exploitation, the section has developed a substantial reputation inside NATO and is regularly invited to offer policy and technical expertise.
