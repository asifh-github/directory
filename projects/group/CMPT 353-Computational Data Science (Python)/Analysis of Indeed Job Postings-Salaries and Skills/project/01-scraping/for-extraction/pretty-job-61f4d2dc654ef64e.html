             Wiliot was founded by the team that invented one of the technologies at the heart of 5G. Their next vision was to develop an IoT sticker, a computing element that can power itself by harvesting radio frequency energy, bringing connectivity and intelligence to everyday products and packaging, things previously disconnect from the IoT. This revolutionary mixture of cloud and semiconductor technology is being used by some of the world’s largest consumer, retail, food and pharmaceutical companies to change the way we make, distribute, sell, use and recycle products.

             We are looking for a data scientist with experience building simulations to join the team and develop a cutting-edge deployment model that captures the complexities of chaotic environments. This will be a multi-year, iterative journey, as we start with very simple statistical models, and work up to a full-blown simulation tool that’s usable by external partners. You will be the first hire of a large team, so the role will be both tactical and strategic, and so you will also inform the roadmap and priorities as we develop these tools.
