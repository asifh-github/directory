                 Why We’re Hiring
                </b>
</h3>
<p>
                At Harvest, you’ll be working with a team of honest and respectful engineers who value giving and receiving feedback and trust that they can count on each other.
               </p>
<p>
                Harvest Engineering consists of Product Engineering and Platform Engineering. Within Platform Engineering there are currently three teams, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), Data and Security Engineering (DSE), and Engineering Productivity (EP)
               </p>
<p>
                The Data and Security Engineering (DSE) team is responsible for providing infrastructure and tooling that supports both internal and external data science and security needs. On the data engineering side, much of their work involves creating pipelines from various systems and tools, processing the incoming data, and pushing it into our data warehouse for future consumption. For security, engineers use and/or build tools and partner with external vendors to assess various threats to Harvest and our customers’ data. They then work to improve our applications and build additional tooling to keep us safe.
