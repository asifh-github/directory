                The Values That We Hope You Share:
               </b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>
                 We Care:
                </b>
                We care about our drug candidates, our Recursionauts, their families, each other, our communities, the patients we aim to serve and their loved ones. We also care about our work.
               </li>
<li>
<b>
                 We Learn:
                </b>
                Learning from the diverse perspectives of our fellow Recursionauts, and from failure, is an essential part of how we make progress.
               </li>
<li>
<b>
                 We Deliver:
                </b>
                We are unapologetic that our expectations for delivery are extraordinarily high. There is urgency to our existence: we sprint at maximum engagement, making time and space to recover.
               </li>
<li>
<b>
                 Act Boldly with Integrity:
                </b>
                No company changes the world or reinvents an industry without being bold. It must be balanced; not by timidity, but by doing the right thing even when no one is looking.
               </li>
<li>
<b>
                 We are One Recursion:
                </b>
                We operate with a 'company first, team second' mentality. Our success comes from working as one interdisciplinary team.
               </li>
</ul>
<p>
               Recursion spends time and energy connecting every aspect of work to these values. They aren't static, but regularly discussed and questioned because we make decisions rooted in those values in our day-to-day work. You can read more about our values and how we live them every day here.
              </p>

<b>
                More About Recursion
               </b>
</p>
<p>
               Central to our mission is the Recursion Operating System, or Recursion OS, that combines an advanced infrastructure layer to generate what we believe is one of the world's largest and fastest-growing proprietary biological and chemical datasets and the Recursion Map, a suite of custom software, algorithms, and machine learning tools that we use to explore foundational biology unconstrained by human bias and navigate to new biological insights which may accelerate our programs. We are a biotechnology company scaling more like a technology company. Recursion is proudly headquartered in Salt Lake City.
