               Overview
              </p>
<p>
               The Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) is a not-for-profit corporation that operates three Federally Funded Research &amp; Development Centers (FFRDCs). IDA’s Systems and Analyses Center is located in Alexandria, Virginia and is comprised of eight research divisions providing objective analyses of national security issues, particularly those requiring scientific and technical expertise, and conducts related research on other national challenges.
              </p>
<p>
               The IDA Data Science Fellowship provides recent graduates a unique opportunity to develop and apply data science skills to important issues in national security. The Data Science Fellowship is a project-based learning experience within a variety of research areas. In a collaborative team environment, Fellows perform data manipulation and statistical, econometric, predictive, descriptive, and other quantitative analyses to help answer important sponsor-funded research questions as well as internal-funded business operations questions. In the course of research, Fellows will apply advanced data science tools, possibly including machine learning, artificial intelligence, statistics, or various big data methodologies. Fellows should expect to learn while using their critical thinking, creativity, and analytic skills to contribute to interdisciplinary project teams.
              </p>
<p>
               Fellows will have opportunity to work on several research questions during their 3-year terms. Specific future research projects are unpredictable, subject to ever-changing analytical needs of sponsors and/or internal business operations questions. However, example projects include:
              </p>
<ul>
<li>
                Appraisal of current DoD investments in a broad range of areas: from human factors to autonomous systems, from materials science to nuclear weapons effects, from social behaviors to quantum computing;
               </li>
<li>
                Analyze and research questions on DoD personnel, military readiness and efficacy, and organizational efficiency topics.
               </li>
<li>
                Assessment of federal agency information and computing architectures that support data science applications (i.e., large, distributed data sets and computational assets);
               </li>
<li>
                Application of data exploration, text analytics, forecasting, statistical inference, simulation to areas of military personnel, manpower, and acquisition of DOD weapon systems.
               </li>
<li>
                Improve IDA’s data architecture to support efficient internal operations
               </li>
