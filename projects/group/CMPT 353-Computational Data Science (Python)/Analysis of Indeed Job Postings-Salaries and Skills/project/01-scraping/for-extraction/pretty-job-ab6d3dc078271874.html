               Modern Intelligence is seeking an AI Research Scientist to help lead fundamental research and development into compositional, hierarchical neural networks and their application to the defense sector in areas such as sensor fusion, decision making, autonomy, complex inference, electronic warfare, and more.

               Modern is using proprietary advances in information and complexity theory to build one AI for defense. Our hierarchical approach provides a dramatic scaling advantage over classical neural networks, naturally enabling very high accuracy on few-shot learning for novel problems, and in many cases, the ability to solve previously-unsolvable problems.

               We’re looking for an experienced ML practitioner and insightful theorist who believes that there are fundamental, foundational improvements in the field just waiting to be discovered, and that the current incentives in the industry, towards incremental improvements and away from real innovation, create an enormous opportunity for smart people to rethink how we do ML. You’ll join us in improving our compression and NAS algorithms, you’ll bring your own theoretical contributions to the table, you’ll help communicate with our platform engineering team to turn our ideas into practical reality, and you’ll get your hands dirty with theoretically-motivated experiments and real-world problems. As an early hire, you will have the opportunity and active encouragement to grow into leadership and supervisory roles as the company expands.

</h3>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
                  PhD or equivalent experience in Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, or related field. Candidates still in their graduate program will be considered.
                 </li>
<li>
                  Strong proficiency in at least one popular ML framework, e.g. Tensorflow or Pytorch. The ideal candidate will have hand-rolled their own ML training environment, even if in a very limited capacity.
                 </li>
<li>
                  Strong proficiency in coding and data science.
                 </li>
<li>
                  Proficiency in Probability Theory and other mathematical areas relevant to ML. The ideal candidate will have strong proficiency in multiple areas of mathematics.
                 </li>
<li>
                  A demonstrable track record of foundational thinking in ML. The ideal candidate will have a publication record demonstrating relevant areas of interest and the ability to make non-incremental novel contributions.
                 </li>
<li>
                  Experience with computer vision models, natural language models, multimodal data and/or sensor fusion.
                 </li>
<li>
                  Excellent communication skills, and the ability to work effectively in a team.

               If you’re a brilliant high-level thinker, and don’t want to waste your career on incremental advances; if you’re interested in working with an equally brilliant, dedicated, and close-knit team to develop groundbreaking approaches to ML; and if you want to see those approaches turn into real-world products that are orders of magnitude better than anything else on the market; then come work with us.
