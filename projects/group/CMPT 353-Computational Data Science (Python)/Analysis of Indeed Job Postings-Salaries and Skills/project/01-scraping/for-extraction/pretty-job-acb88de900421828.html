             Description:
             <p>
              Lynker is seeking a talented Water Resources Data Scientist with Snow Hydrology experience to support activities focused on National Water Model (NWM) development. Technological advances are driving exponential growth in data. Extracting meaningful information quickly from the modern day deluge of hydrologic and related data is a requirement for the success of the NWM.
             </p>
<p>
              The Water Resources Data Scientist selected will focus on developing techniques to generate decision ready data and predicting future outcomes from environmental or operational data. This work will include tapping into big data insights by collaborating with other data scientists — individuals with interdisciplinary backgrounds that include GIS, Science, data analysis, statistics, data visualization, computer science, and mathematics.
             </p>
<p>
              At the NWC, hydrologic data science is focused on modeling: combining theory-based models with powerful predictive tools (e.g., deep learning); Data pipelines: Building efficiencies through reproducible and collaborative data workflows; Data visualizations: Sharing insights with innovative and thoughtful visualizations.
             </p>
<p>
              The position will also support other projects outside of OWP/NWM support.
             </p>
             Requirements:
             <p>
