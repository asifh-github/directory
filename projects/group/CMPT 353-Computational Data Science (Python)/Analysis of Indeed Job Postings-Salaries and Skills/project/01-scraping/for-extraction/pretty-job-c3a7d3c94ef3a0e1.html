              About Lowe’s Innovation Labs:
             </b>
<br/>
             Lowe’s Innovation Labs (www.lowesinnovationlabs.com) imagines, explores, and accelerates the future of home improvement retail. Our work supports Lowe’s ability to thrive in a future where the digital and physical worlds seamlessly blend. Our work ranges from 3D visualization, AI/ML, robotics, digital twins, and other things we can’t talk about right now.
             <br/>

              Job Summary:
             </b>
<br/>
             Lowe’s is undergoing a transformation – and at the center of it is a new experience between people and their homes through emerging data and technologies.
             <br/>
             The Lowe’s Innovation Labs team plays a critical role in driving this transformation.
             <br/>
             Home improvement is complex. Most home improvement projects require a fundamental understanding of the space in your home – before you even get started.
             <br/>
<br/>
             And if you’re like us, much of the critical info about your home is all over the place, written down and stashed in a folder, or simply nonexistent. We’re building a future that leverages the rise of emerging technologies like LiDAR, computer vision, AI, and mixed reality hardware: technologies that will not only sense and understand your home’s space, but will also put all of that data into your hands in useful ways whenever you need it, wherever you are.
             <br/>
             We’re looking for a Data Scientist to partner with our Data and Machine Learning Engineers to build and validate datasets and data annotation strategies. The Data Scientist will develop, train, and refine machine learning models based on performance and feedback.
             <br/>
             This is a role for a person interested in Data Science and ML, who has a solid engineering foundation, a hunger for learning new technologies, and is a strong communicator, innovator, and collaborator.
             <br/>
<b>
              What you’ll do:
             </b>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>
               Identify and validate business use cases that can be solved with AI
              </li>
<li>
               Analyze and visualize data at all stages of the modeling pipeline
              </li>
<li>
               Design and develop custom algorithms and data science models
              </li>
<li>
               Identify additional datasets for use in models and algorithms
              </li>
<li>
               Develop custom tools and libraries to optimize the data science modeling workflow
              </li>
</ul>
<br/>

              Minimum Qualifications:
             </b>
