               ABOUT YOU
              </b>
</p>
<p>
              You have a graduate degree in a quantitative field and a bit of experience (even if only internships). Ideally you are obtaining a Master's in Data Science and currently available for an internship.
             </p>
<p>
              You code in R or Python and don't mind getting your hands dirty working with structured and unstructured data from a variety of sources.
             </p>
<p>
              You build models which will enhance Customer Experience and Media Performance by leveraging machine learning and statistical modeling.
             </p>
<p>
              You enjoy working on more than one project simultaneously and applying new techniques and are never one to rest on your past accomplishments.
             </p>
<p>
              What else? Maybe you're passionate about social issues? Or maybe you have an impressive vinyl collection? Perhaps you spend as much time exploring nature as you do writing code? We'd love to know what makes you, you.
