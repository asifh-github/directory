               What we're building and why we're building it.
              </b>
</p>
<p>
              Fetch is a build-first technology company creating a rewards program to power the world. Over the last 5 years we've grown from 0 to 18M active users and taken over the rewards game in the US with our free app. The foundation has been laid. In the next 5 years we will become a global platform that completely transforms how people connect with brands.
             </p>
<p>
              It all comes down to two core beliefs. First, that people deserve to be rewarded when they create value. If a third party directly benefits from an action you take or data you provide, you should be rewarded for it. And not just the "you get to use our product!" cop-out. We're talkin' real, explicit value. Fetch points, perhaps.
             </p>
<p>
              Second, we also believe brands need a better and more direct connection with what matters most to them: their customers. - Brands need to understand what people are doing, and have a direct line to be able to do something about it. Not just advertise, but ACT. Sounds nice right?
             </p>
<p>
              That's why we're building the world's rewards platform. A closed-loop, standardized rewards layer across all consumer behavior that will lead to happier shoppers and stronger brands.
