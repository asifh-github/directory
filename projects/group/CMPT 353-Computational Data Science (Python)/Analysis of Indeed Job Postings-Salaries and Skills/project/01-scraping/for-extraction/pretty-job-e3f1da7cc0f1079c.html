</h2>
</div>
<p>
               Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.
               <br/>
<br/>
               Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.
               <br/>
<br/>
               There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

                Square is growing its financial services footprint through the launch of new products and international expansions. This is an exciting time for our business and we are looking for a Data Scientist to join our Finance and Strategy Banking team to lead analytical and strategic projects for our banking business.
               </p>
<p>
                This position will be fundamental in shaping our product strategy and communicating critical decisions to Product leadership, our Bank partners and to Block management. Success in this role requires the ability to exercise excellent business acumen while often operating autonomously without existing problem solving frameworks or precedent solutions. We are thus looking for someone with a strong analytical background who can manage and drive solutions across a variety of strategic and financially focused challenges.
               </p>
<p>
                As a Data Scientist, you will be embedded within the Square Banking Finance &amp; Strategy team, leveraging data analytics, statistics, and predictive modeling techniques to empower data-driven decision making across our growing suite of financial products offered to Square sellers. In this role, you will collaborate closely with Business Intelligence, Finance, Product Management, Marketing and other cross-functional team members to drive recommendations that influence the direction of our Square Banking business.
               </p>
<p>
                Candidates can sit in any Square office in the US or be remote from any US state with the exception of Alaska.
