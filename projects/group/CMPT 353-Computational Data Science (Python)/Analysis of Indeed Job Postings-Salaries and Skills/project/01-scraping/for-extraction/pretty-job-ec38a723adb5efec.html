             The People Analytics project aims to strengthen the analytical capabilities of Human Resource (HR) leaders across MSF so that HR planning is more strategic, data-driven and evidence-based. We are applying statistical modeling, predictive algorithms and future-state simulation to HR data to develop tools to aid in strategic workforce planning. We are also developing our talent analytics capacity to examine causal relationships between HR and resulting business outcomes.
