              Events in recent years have made us all too familiar with the havoc that natural disasters can wreak, and the increasing frequency and intensity with which they are occurring. Despite record levels of losses, conventional methods of risk modeling continue to paint at best an incomplete picture of these threats.
             </p>
<p>
              Zesty.ai uses novel data gathering and data science methods to produce higher quality information about the risks to property from catastrophes like floods and wildfires. While AI alone may not be able to thwart these disasters, it can help us become more prepared for them, and ultimately that will lead to better outcomes.
