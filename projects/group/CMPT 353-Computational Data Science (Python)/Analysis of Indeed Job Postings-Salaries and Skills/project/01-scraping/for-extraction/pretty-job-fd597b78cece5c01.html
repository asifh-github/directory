              About Revel
             </b>
<br/>
             Revel's mission is to accelerate EV adoption by providing the infrastructure and services that make it easy to go electric. While other companies set goals for 2030, we're focused on change we can make today. We're also focused on cities, which have the biggest barriers to EV adoption but the most potential for change.
            </p>

              Our Operating Principles
             </b>
<br/>
             Revel's Operating Principles represent who we are, how we act, and what we believe. They define our culture.
             <br/>
<b>
              Empathy.
             </b>
             We seek to understand the experiences and perspectives of each other, our customers and the communities where we operate.

<b>
              Ownership.
             </b>

             <br/>
<b>
              Humility.
             </b>
             We take our work seriously but not ourselves. We're approachable, curious, and know we have a lot to learn.
             <br/>
<b>
              Adaptability.
             </b>
             We expect change and quickly adjust our approach to reflect new information. We know success requires seeing opportunity in obstacles and relentlessly improving.
             <br/>
<b>
              Simplicity.
             </b>
