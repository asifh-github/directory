              As Head of Data Science, you will lead our elite team of data scientists who work closely with product and engineering teams and are subject-matter experts in user dynamics at Duolingo. The team focuses on detecting, explaining and actioning against behavioral shifts within our complex, constantly evolving business using extensive datasets. Your superpower is the ability to translate business questions into data science projects, and data analysis or statistical models back into decisions. As the data science leader, you'll shape how 'all things' data and data science contribute to Duolingo's strategy.
