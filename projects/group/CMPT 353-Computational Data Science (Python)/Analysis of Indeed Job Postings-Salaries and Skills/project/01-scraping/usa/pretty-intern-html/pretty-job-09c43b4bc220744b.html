                Netflix is reinventing entertainment from end to end. We are revolutionizing how shows and movies are produced, pushing technological boundaries to efficiently deliver streaming video at massive scale over the internet, and continuously improving the personalization of how entertainment is presented to our more than 220 million members around the globe.

                Applied Machine Learning Research at Netflix improves various aspects of our business, including personalization algorithms, search, systems optimization, content valuation, tooling for artists, and streaming video optimization. As such, our research spans many Machine Learning areas, including recommender systems, causal inference, reinforcement learning, computer vision, computer graphics, image and video processing, natural language processing, optimization, operations research and systems. Great applied research also requires great Machine Learning infrastructure, another large area of emphasis at Netflix.

                In Summer 2023, Netflix will be hosting a small number of Machine Learning Research internships and Machine Learning Engineering &amp; Infrastructure internships. Applicants are encouraged to express their interest in one or both types of internships.
