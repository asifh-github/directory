<div>
              Our research interns are mentored one-on-one by seasoned researchers and have the opportunity to collaborate with engineering and annotation teams to address real-world problems using challenging data. This internship aims to be the first to lead to publications at prestigious ML conferences. Internships are entirely remote, can begin any time next year, and typically last 16 weeks. However, we are always open to collaborating beyond the internship.
             </div>

              In 2022, our interns were actively involved in working on each of the NLP and CV projects, resulting in patent and paper submissions (which are currently under review). For more information on our past research work before 2022, refer to these two publications about Autonomous Medical Coding and using Deep Learning for Payer Response Prediction.

              This is a remote (US Based Only) internship opportunity, and participation in the research internship program requires you to be physically located in the US for the duration of the internship.
