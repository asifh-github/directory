            Enthought powers digital transformation for science. Our technology and deep scientific expertise enable faster discovery and continuous innovation. We solve complex problems for the most innovative and respected organizations across the life sciences, material sciences, chemical, and semiconductor industries.
            <br/>
<br/>
            Enthought is seeking a full-time graduate summer intern to take on challenging projects and work closely with a team in the Materials Science Solutions Group in our Austin, TX headquarters. The Graduate Intern will most likely be working on an applied data science project developing tools and use cases for machine learning, AI, and optimization to be used in the materials, chemistry, and semiconductor domains. The project will be a part of a larger ongoing development effort with our academic and industry partners.
            <br/>
<br/>
            Prior working knowledge of Python is a must and experience with common open source scientific computing and data science libraries, like numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, etc. is a plus. Software engineering experience with things like object oriented design, code refactoring, git workflows, continuous integration and UI design are also valuable. Teamwork abilities, organizational skills, communication skills, ability to solve problems independently, and an eagerness to learn new things are also critical. Ideal candidates will be pursuing or have recently finished a graduate degree in materials, chemistry, physics, or related physical science and engineering discipline.
            <br/>
            We will accept applications for summer internships through December 15. Internship selections are made by January 15.
            <br/>
<br/>
            Enthought is headquartered in Austin, Texas, with offices in Houston, Texas; Cambridge, United Kingdom; Zürich, Switzerland; and Tokyo, Japan. We are an equal opportunity employer.
