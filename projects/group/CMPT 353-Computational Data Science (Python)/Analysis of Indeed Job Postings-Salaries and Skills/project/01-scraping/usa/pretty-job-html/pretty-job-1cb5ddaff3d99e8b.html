                     DESCRIPTION
                    </p>
<p>
                     As a Data Scientist working on computational biology, you will be joining a team making use of diverse ‘omics data in different disease settings. You will work in a collaborative, cross-functional team to develop novel viral genomics methods for public health applications, with an emphasis on viral metagenomic analyses of wastewater samples. You will work closely with your lab colleagues to refine the best laboratory techniques based on data quality, set up robust data processing QC pipelines and perform downstream analyses to answer important public health questions. You will develop new methods and models to help derive insights from our proprietary platforms. You may also work with internal and external collaborators to design new studies in which to apply these molecular platforms and analyses.
