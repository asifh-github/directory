              </b>
              focuses on accelerating foundational research, developing standards and models, and cultivating new ideas to make a broad, transformational impact on science.

               MindScope

              program seeks to understand the transformations, sometimes called computations, in coding and decoding that lead from photons to behavior and conscious experience by observing, perturbing, and modeling the physical transformations of signals in the cortical-thalamic visual system within a few perception-action cycles.
             </p>
<p>
              We are seeking a Scientist to be an essential member of a team investigating cell type-specific function by integrating in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging with in vitro spatial transcriptomics. The role of this Scientist will be to perform data analysis and modeling of optical physiology data to study neural coding and circuit dynamics. By linking physiology to gene expression, this scientist will study functional properties and interactions of multiple cell types during visual perception.
             </p>
<p>
              The datasets and tools created as part of this project will be publicly released as a resource for the community. At the interface of neuroscience and data science, this Scientist will contribute to the development of standardized open-source workflows for data processing, visualization, and computational analysis.
             </p>
<p>
              The ideal candidate will have strong computational and programming skills, experience with the analysis of in vivo imaging data, an understanding of sensory physiology, and an interest in cell type-specific circuit function and open science. As part of a highly collaborative team environment, good communication and enthusiasm for working with and learning from others is essential to this role.
             </p>
<p>
              The Allen Institute believes that team science significantly benefits from the participation of diverse voices, experiences, and backgrounds. High-quality science can only be produced when it includes different perspectives. We are committed to increasing diversity across every team and encourage people from all backgrounds to apply for this role.
