             ABOUT LeaseLock: *
             <br/>
             In a perfect world, every lease would end with zero balance. Properties and tenants could go their separate ways without squabbling over outstanding debts and deposits. Those debts and deposits make up hundreds of millions of dollars each year and most of it is just forfeited— languishing in escrow, sent to collections, or simply written off as bad debt.
             <br/>
             At LeaseLock, we believe in a better way. We’re empowering the built world with better technology and equipping property owners and operators with a new generation of financial tools to reduce risk, recapture revenue, and optimize asset performance. Our financial technology creates more valuable, efficient properties by turning unpredictable loss and damage into dependable operating income, getting each lease closer to zero balance.
             <br/>
             Powered by our data platform and AI risk engine, LeaseLock develops solutions, like our flagship lease insurance, that are driving the future of residential rental real estate. Launched in 2016 and growing rapidly, we’ve insured over $3 billion in leases with clients representing the top property management companies and ownership groups in the country.
