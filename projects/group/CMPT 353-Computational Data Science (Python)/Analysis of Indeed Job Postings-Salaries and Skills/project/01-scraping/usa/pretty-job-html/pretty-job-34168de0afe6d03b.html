                The Playback pod within the Streaming Data Engineering team partners with client and edge system teams to produce playback datasets, a source of truth for title and ads performance, title popularity (Netflix top 10), and member quality of experience. This team empowers Netflix with data to drive content decisions and understand where content is being watched, on what devices, in what quality, or through which ISP. It enables analytics about client behavior, server choices, or decisions on what content should be placed in which parts of our content network.
