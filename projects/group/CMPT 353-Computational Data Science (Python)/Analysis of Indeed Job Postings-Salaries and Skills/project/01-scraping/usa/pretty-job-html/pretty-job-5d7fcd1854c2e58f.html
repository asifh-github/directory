            As a Data Engineer , you will create data pipelines on our next-generation database build. You will assist with building robust, fault-tolerant data pipelines that collect, assemble, transform and aggregate distributed data into databases, operational data stores, data integration hubs, and data lakes. You will compile and install scalable cloud-based database systems and prepare data for analytical and operational uses. You will work to lay the groundwork for data consumers to easily retrieve and examine data sets to glean knowledge and insights.
            <br/>
<br/>
            IT Data Engineering is responsible for designing and developing enterprise data collection, aggregation, and access systems for IDEXX's global business environment. We work with traditional data architectures such as enterprise data warehousing and larger cloud-based data centralization systems like data integration hubs. Our products are used to synchronize billions of data points between enterprise applications such as global ERP and CRM applications, collect and normalize reference lab results and clinical utilization, and create easy-to-access data sources for enterprise analytics, sales enablement tools, and data science initiatives.
            <br/>
            Our team includes a range of data engineers, data architects, and data-centric business system analysts, with a heavy focus on cloud-based "big data" projects. Some team members provide knowledge and support over our traditional data warehouse applications, building upon these environments with SQL and traditional ETL methods. At the same time, our newest technology addition expands our data models via Snowflake, bringing the best of cloud scale and compute capabilities, along with long-lived data engineering practices.
