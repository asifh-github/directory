<p>
              We’re looking for a thoughtful, curious, and resourceful Data Scientist to join our growing team. You’re comfortable presenting insights to clients, and thrive in situations where you have to learn about and solve a client’s specific problems. This role is the technical face that accompanies our clients’ experience working with us, meaning that you will be the person leading them to solutions by presenting project results, interacting with clients in a consultative manner, and supporting overall customer success. This is a fully-remote position with the option to work from our home office in Pittsburgh, PA, with occasional company meetings in-person.
             </p>
<p>
              Core duties include:
             </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
                Architect, develop and deploy models and algorithms using customer, open source, and proprietary data; assess model quality, and validate and iterate on those models
               </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
                Own the process of integrating customer data, analyzing it using our methodology and your data instincts, and make it deliver value to the customer
               </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
                Evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of public and private data sources, choose the right ones for our platform, and make them ready to sing harmony to a customer dataset’s melody
               </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
                Help design and automate our customer dataset analysis and insights delivery process, to smoothly handle a wider variety and higher velocity of data
               </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
                Act as the technical bridge between the customer and the product, making our tools useful, relaying product feedback, and customizing to a client’s needs where necessary
               </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
                Leaning on your empathy and leadership skills, you will work with our clients in a consultative capacity, learning about their particular needs and being their advocate both internally and externally. That means participating in client meetings, leading technical discussions, presenting project results, interacting with clients in a consultative manner, and other technical customer-facing engagement, as needed.
               </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
              We expect the balance of your work day-to-day to be 60-70% client project-centric work, 20-30% scripting to improve our shared data analytics tooling, and ~10% account management or support needs. The hope is that feedback from your client experiences can directly make our systems more efficient, and eventually more self-serve, reducing the need for clients to have consultative project teams at all.
             </p>
