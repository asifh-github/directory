             </div>
<div>
              1. We are data-first: data isn’t a buzzword to us, it’s at the core of our technology and in the DNA of our decision-making processes.
             </div>
<div>
              2. We are relentless: we know the impact our work will have on the world and are in pursuit of extremely lofty goals - we don't settle at “good enough.”
             </div>
<div>
              3. We are innovative: Our founders, executives, and early team members are united by a love of thinking differently and seeing groundbreaking ideas come to life.
             </div>
<div>
              4. We are thoughtful: From the way we treat each other to the way we unpack tough problems, we are considerate, respectful, and holistic.
             </div>
<div>
              5. We are adaptive: In a high-tech world, nothing is set in stone - we recognize and embrace that in our strategy and culture.
